# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.



For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. _Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

1. Set up [your Github "Lab Hub" repository](../../../) by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Spring/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to post links to your submissions on your readme.md so we can find them easily.

### For lab, you will need:

1. Paper
1. Markers/ Pen
1. Smart Phone--Main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
1. Computer--we will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls
1. Found objects and materials--you’ll have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other device. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case. Be creative!
1. Scissors

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process.
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction.
1. Submit these in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same for each person in the group.

Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in the readme.

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage the interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.


**Setting:** The interaction is happening in a person's bedroom before he/she leaves the house.<br>
**Players:** Every family member in the household could be the player.<br>
**Activity:** An indicator light will be connected to the weather App on the user's phone and display different colors based on the weather of the day (ex. white/snowy, blue/rainy, red/sunny, green/windy, etc). Before the user leaves the house, he/she could check the light and dress accordingly. <br>
**Goals:** The goal of the family member is to know what the weather is it for the day without having to check his/her phone so that he/she will remember to dress appropriatly. <br>

Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

![storyboard](https://github.com/quinn997/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/storyboard.png?raw=true)

Present your idea to the other people in your breakout room. You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.
**Summarize feedback you got here.**<br>
**Feedback:** The current light will not be able to indicate if the weather is mixed. Also, people who are visually impaired will have diffculties when using this device. 

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**<br>
If the light is showing white(snow), the user know it's snowing outside but he/she won't know how heavy this snow is. 

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**<br>
In addition to the basic colors, the tints and shades of the colors can be used to represent the percentage of the weather. For example, light blue could be used to represent light rain.

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**<br>
I didn't have any problems with the set up process, and it worked well on both of the devices. Although I have set the brightness to full on both my phone and computer, the color shown on the tinkerbelle device (my phone) is slightly different from the color shown on the Jane Wren controller(computer).

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**<br>
**link to the video:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b1U7HGirpHW0vL8iVtOkB8O9JBzxjckL/view?usp=sharing

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

**Show the follow-up work here.**<br>
**Paper Prototyped interaction video:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nsdKHVZkSAEc0-OAhhY6iimLo-0Hr2H2/view?usp=sharing

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

**Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**
![costume](https://github.com/quinn997/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/costume.JPG?raw=true)
The device will look like a lamp and it will be placed on a table or any flat surface. I included a stand to the lamp in my paper prototype(As shown in paper prototyped interaction video in Part D), but I couldn't find any resouces near me to add the stand to my current costume design.

**What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**<br>
I made the cover of the light using a piece of white paper, and put my phone inside the cover to be used as the light source. This way it looks like an actual lamp. 

## Part F. Record

**Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**<br>
**Prototyped interaction video:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hdey7Th0oyou_wx_Z33XPW-oCfuiaUom/view?usp=sharing

**Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

**Summarize feedback from your partners here.**<br>
James Wang(jw2594) - James was able to tell that the device was giving hints on the weather before leaving home. He thought the idea was interesting and suggested me to demonstrate more cases in the video to make the interaction more understandable. <br>

Hangyu Lin(hl2357) - Hangyu thought it was hard to tell what the device was supposed to be doing because there was only one case shown in the video and there was no light change. Similar to what James said, he suggested me to act out multiple cases with different light colors. <br>

Andrew Liu (jl3983) - Andrew suggested to add flashing lights/shades of colors to the device in order to demonstrate different amount of precipitation/snow.

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors, 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

**Document everything here.**
